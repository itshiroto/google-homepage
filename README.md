# Hiroto's Google Homepage Project
> Based on The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/html-css)

This is my attempt to recreate Google Homepage. From this project, I learned a lot about flexbox, divs, and many others. And if you see my repo, there's only two files (well, three if you count the README). That's because I want to make this project as simple as possible. All icons and pictures were taken by the Google Source Code (the SVG and IMG) and my GitHub Profile Photo.

I hope this project will not be the last project for my Web Development Journey.
